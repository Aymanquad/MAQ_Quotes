                <h2><span>The Beauty of Time</span></h2>
                <br>
                <p>What is Time ? Time is a relative concept which is infinite and endless ,
                    and yet it is impossible to understand it. Time cannot exist without space and neither can 
                    space without time . <br>
                    Ron Jim gave the hypothesis of Time being the great equilizer. It doesn't halt for 
                    anyone and keeps enhancing forward without a nip of kindness for the living. 
                    Einstien , the legend who studied space and time more than any of us , declared 
                    Time as the 4th Dimension . <br>
                    You see , time only has 1 direction and continues to flow so independently .<br>
                    The only thing that can move through space like time is gravity . 
                    time and gravity are completly independent of each other and they are the only 2 imp 
                    relations to be seen in any physical entity . <br>
                    is time a loop? yes. Every instance of time is divided broadly into 3 : past, present and future right ? 
                    Hence the triangular loop for every single instance .
                    Time is an endless loop(âˆž) in which we all are , and the beginning of any loop is always its end .

                <h2><span>The Art of War</span></h2>
                <br>
                <p>Wars are inescapable . The never ending loop of battles keep ongoing . 
                    All of us are fighting wars with our own struggles and problems . All of us are warriers from the 
                    day we were born . Fight the shit u are going through and do stuff that will benifit the family , 
                    do the stuff that keeps u efficient in some way , that keeps u motivated to do something nice rather 
                    than the wrong shit.
                    <br>
                    The art of war is a famous book written by Sun Tzu . The best line in his book according to me was... 
                    " The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting " . If u know your opponents 
                    moves/strategy , you already won . To actually win wars , u must know your enemy and to know them , you must 
                    become your enemy . 
                    <br>
                    To live in this world , no matter who you are , you should know how to fight or atleast defend yourself .
                    Consider youself facing head on with someone , with fists , this ain't your regular rap battle nigga , 
                    Now , Even if u don't know how to fight , you atleast plan something before striking right ? 
                    You see , in a 1v1 , the win goes to the person who striked fast enough  or  to the one who chained his 
                    continous moves to knock u out . Both of these things depend on your reaction time . 
                    What ur opponent needs is a 0.5 sec delay in ur regular movemements to smash your little face , and that is all 
                    you need as well .

                <h2><span>The Survival Instinct </span></h2>
                <br>
                <p>Now , Imagine that you just woke up with a splash and u realize you are drowning and a large 
                    stone is tied to your feet which is pulling u down like crazi hell .  <br>
                    So , whats the first thing that hits your mind ? Where is my morning coffee .. or .. Untie/Cut that silly ass rock off you feet 
                    and swim back up ?<br>
                    Yea ik, the thought of the 1st option is itself ridiculous. The answer hits u so hell fast and 
                    you'll prob even bite the rope down if needed. Now , this crazi instant urge of u wanting to live 
                    and see another morning with a coffee in your hand , is known as the Survival instinct.<br>
                    This drive of surviving is so mindblowing . If u were unable to swim , u try to swim . if you see a cheetah
                    approaching you , you don't think shit about how fast he is and run . Right ? <br>
                    So basically , at that very moment ,in the face of death ,no matter what , we try to run/escape and 
                    by doing so , we unlock our true potential for an instant.
